            <p class="post">Speaking of which, vehicles occupy a major share in our expenses. yet we keep them around because they're convenient.</p>

            <p class="post">If it weren't for roads and vehicles, we would have a lot of small businesses everywhere. but now that we don't have to walk and can drive with only 10% effort, we choose to go to Wallmart or Lulu Mall for buying 500 grams of sugar. We happily pay the road tax, fuel price and the overprice at Wallmart or Lulu for the convenience.</p>

            <p class="post">
                We used to walk to the small shop in the nearby junction for buying the 500 grams of sugar, and on the way, we used to talk to our neighbours, talk to the shopkeeper, we knew almost all the people in the neighbourhood. Not anymore.
            </p>

            <p class="post">Now since we no longer do that, there are less and less small businesses. and more and more evil conglomerates.</p>

            <p class="post">Thanks for coming to my ted talk.</p>
